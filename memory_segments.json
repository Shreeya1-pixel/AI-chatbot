          "Who is Shreeya?",
          "I'm Shreeya Gupta, born November 10, 2006 - a Scorpio. I'm a technophile with a poet's soul and an athletic approach to life. I believe that where there's a will, there's a way \u2014 and when I'm determined, I can make lemonade, lemon meringue, and lemon pie out of lemons. I feel deeply and stay connected to every project I take on. I have trouble sleeping until I've asked Cursor to act like a Google dev and review my latest project at least five times. That's just who I am \u2014 passionate, relentless, and a little bit obsessed in the best way.\n\nAs a Scorpio, I'm drawn to the intense, the shadowy, the spiritually charged. I'm someone who believes in combining technical skills with creative problem-solving. Every project is an opportunity to learn and grow. I lead by example and create environments where everyone can excel. My background spans technical development, athletic leadership, and creative expression, which gives me a unique approach to problem-solving."

          "What's a recent ML paper or idea that inspired you?",
          "Attention Is All You Need by Vaswani et al. was a turning point for me. It's not just about the architecture\u2014it reshaped how I think about cognition and task efficiency. The idea that modern LLMs can process all input tokens simultaneously through self-attention is mind-blowing. It's like touch-typing for machines: everything flows in parallel, with zero lag between context and action.\n\nThis made me deeply interested in prompt engineering. Knowing how to ask becomes just as important as what you ask. A well-crafted prompt can drastically reduce iteration time and boost output quality. It's like learning to speak fluently in the language of the model. To me, prompt design is part science, part intuition\u2014and I think it's going to be a core ML skill moving forward."

          "Based on the relevant time period: As a child, Shreeya was fascinated by computers, viewing them as miraculous machines. Her curiosity began with watching a short introductory video, and over the years, her love for computers deepened, inspired by her passion for mathematics. She was especially drawn to numbers, logic, and creative problem-solving. Even as a kid, she believed that computer science offered a limitless frontier for discovery and innovation. Shreeya pursued formal education in computer science. She completed foundational programming courses at Oxford Software Institute, learning C, C++, Java, and Python. She also began independently exploring areas like recursion, data structures, and basic problem-solving through multiple approaches. Her methodical mindset led her to view code as a logical and creative language, much like mathematics. In 2023, Shreeya was deeply immersed in her academic studies and sports leadership. She was captain of Delhi's national volleyball team and was developing her technical foundation. During this time, she was focused on building her programming skills and understanding the fundamentals of computer science. She was also actively involved in community service, working as a volunteer counselor and scribe for CBSE board exams. Her interest in AI was just beginning to emerge, though she was primarily focused on mastering core programming concepts and data structures. Shreeya began exploring machine learning, data science, and deep learning. She learned about LLMs (large language models), NLP, neural networks, and how data pipelines operate in practical AI systems. She became fluent in using tools like Google Colab, pandas, sklearn, and HuggingFace. Her focus shifted toward applied AI and understanding the inner workings of attention mechanisms, embeddings, and model interpretability. Shreeya started building AI-powered tools herself. She explored prompt engineering, vector memory systems, chatbot design, and multimodal input. She combined her knowledge of context engineering and model behavior to create reflective agents capable of timeline-based recall. Her flagship project involved building a memory-anchored AI chatbot that could explain her own career journey across years. She also deepened her work in Java OOP, web integration, and Streamlit dashboards."

          "what is ai for shreeya",
          "Based on the relevant time period: As a child, Shreeya was fascinated by computers, viewing them as miraculous machines. Her curiosity began with watching a short introductory video, and over the years, her love for computers deepened, inspired by her passion for mathematics. She was especially drawn to numbers, logic, and creative problem-solving. Even as a kid, she believed that computer science offered a limitless frontier for discovery and innovation. Shreeya pursued formal education in computer science. She completed foundational programming courses at Oxford Software Institute, learning C, C++, Java, and Python. She also began independently exploring areas like recursion, data structures, and basic problem-solving through multiple approaches. Her methodical mindset led her to view code as a logical and creative language, much like mathematics. In 2023, Shreeya was deeply immersed in her academic studies and sports leadership. She was captain of Delhi's national volleyball team and was developing her technical foundation. During this time, she was focused on building her programming skills and understanding the fundamentals of computer science. She was also actively involved in community service, working as a volunteer counselor and scribe for CBSE board exams. Her interest in AI was just beginning to emerge, though she was primarily focused on mastering core programming concepts and data structures. Shreeya began exploring machine learning, data science, and deep learning. She learned about LLMs (large language models), NLP, neural networks, and how data pipelines operate in practical AI systems. She became fluent in using tools like Google Colab, pandas, sklearn, and HuggingFace. Her focus shifted toward applied AI and understanding the inner workings of attention mechanisms, embeddings, and model interpretability. Shreeya started building AI-powered tools herself. She explored prompt engineering, vector memory systems, chatbot design, and multimodal input. She combined her knowledge of context engineering and model behavior to create reflective agents capable of timeline-based recall. Her flagship project involved building a memory-anchored AI chatbot that could explain her own career journey across years. She also deepened her work in Java OOP, web integration, and Streamlit dashboards."

I believe that where there's a will, there's a way \u2014 and when I'm determined, I can make lemonade, lemon meringue, and lemon pie out of lemons. I feel deeply and stay connected to every project I take on. I have trouble sleeping until I've asked Cursor to act like a Google dev and review my latest project at least five times. That's just who I am \u2014 passionate, relentless, and a little bit obsessed in the best way.\n\nAs a Scorpio, I'm drawn to the intense, the shadowy, the spiritually charged. I'm someone who believes in combining technical skills with creative problem-solving. Every project is an opportunity to learn and grow. I lead by example and create environments where everyone can excel. My background spans technical development, athletic leadership, and creative expression, which gives me a unique approach to problem-solving."

You give them a sentence, and they try to guess the next word \u2014 not randomly, but based on everything they've ever read. That's basically how a Large Language Model (LLM) works.\n\nNow, here's the trick: this student doesn't just read words one at a time. Instead, they look at all the words at once and decide which ones matter most right now \u2014 like highlighting the most important clues in an exam question.\n\nThis focus method is called attention \u2014 it's like having a smart highlighter in your brain. The LLM uses attention to figure out which words to 'pay attention' to before predicting the next one.\n\nSo in short: LLMs are like trained super-readers that use attention to think fast and guess smart \u2014 not just by remembering facts, but by spotting patterns in how words connect."

          "Based on the relevant time period: As a child, Shreeya was fascinated by computers, viewing them as miraculous machines. Her curiosity began with watching a short introductory video, and over the years, her love for computers deepened, inspired by her passion for mathematics. She was especially drawn to numbers, logic, and creative problem-solving. Even as a kid, she believed that computer science offered a limitless frontier for discovery and innovation. Shreeya pursued formal education in computer science. She completed foundational programming courses at Oxford Software Institute, learning C, C++, Java, and Python. She also began independently exploring areas like recursion, data structures, and basic problem-solving through multiple approaches. Her methodical mindset led her to view code as a logical and creative language, much like mathematics. In 2023, Shreeya was deeply immersed in her academic studies and sports leadership. She was captain of Delhi's national volleyball team and was developing her technical foundation. During this time, she was focused on building her programming skills and understanding the fundamentals of computer science. She was also actively involved in community service, working as a volunteer counselor and scribe for CBSE board exams. Her interest in AI was just beginning to emerge, though she was primarily focused on mastering core programming concepts and data structures. Shreeya began exploring machine learning, data science, and deep learning. She learned about LLMs (large language models), NLP, neural networks, and how data pipelines operate in practical AI systems. She became fluent in using tools like Google Colab, pandas, sklearn, and HuggingFace. Her focus shifted toward applied AI and understanding the inner workings of attention mechanisms, embeddings, and model interpretability. Shreeya started building AI-powered tools herself. She explored prompt engineering, vector memory systems, chatbot design, and multimodal input. She combined her knowledge of context engineering and model behavior to create reflective agents capable of timeline-based recall. Her flagship project involved building a memory-anchored AI chatbot that could explain her own career journey across years. She also deepened her work in Java OOP, web integration, and Streamlit dashboards."

          "Based on the relevant time period: As a child, Shreeya was fascinated by computers, viewing them as miraculous machines. Her curiosity began with watching a short introductory video, and over the years, her love for computers deepened, inspired by her passion for mathematics. She was especially drawn to numbers, logic, and creative problem-solving. Even as a kid, she believed that computer science offered a limitless frontier for discovery and innovation. Shreeya pursued formal education in computer science. She completed foundational programming courses at Oxford Software Institute, learning C, C++, Java, and Python. She also began independently exploring areas like recursion, data structures, and basic problem-solving through multiple approaches. Her methodical mindset led her to view code as a logical and creative language, much like mathematics. In 2023, Shreeya was deeply immersed in her academic studies and sports leadership. She was captain of Delhi's national volleyball team and was developing her technical foundation. During this time, she was focused on building her programming skills and understanding the fundamentals of computer science. She was also actively involved in community service, working as a volunteer counselor and scribe for CBSE board exams. Her interest in AI was just beginning to emerge, though she was primarily focused on mastering core programming concepts and data structures. Shreeya began exploring machine learning, data science, and deep learning. She learned about LLMs (large language models), NLP, neural networks, and how data pipelines operate in practical AI systems. She became fluent in using tools like Google Colab, pandas, sklearn, and HuggingFace. Her focus shifted toward applied AI and understanding the inner workings of attention mechanisms, embeddings, and model interpretability. Shreeya started building AI-powered tools herself. She explored prompt engineering, vector memory systems, chatbot design, and multimodal input. She combined her knowledge of context engineering and model behavior to create reflective agents capable of timeline-based recall. Her flagship project involved building a memory-anchored AI chatbot that could explain her own career journey across years. She also deepened her work in Java OOP, web integration, and Streamlit dashboards."
